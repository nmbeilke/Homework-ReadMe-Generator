Good README Generator

My motivation was to create a command line app that can quickly and easily create a README file. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. I learned how to work with the Inquirer npm package as well as the fs module.

Make sure to do an "npm install" before running this application.

Run this by navigating to the folder in the command line then doing "node index.js", Then you can simply answer the prompts to generate a README file formatted in Markdown.

Contribute by modifying the index.js file to add more questions or change the formatting.
